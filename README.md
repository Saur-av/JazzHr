# Web Automation for Jazz Hr Platform.
We had a friend whom we met online during lockdown, we used to play games together on Discord.
Gradually he stopped playing with us, he got a new job as Virtual Assistant. 
This is a script I made to automate his job, I have no clue why this was required in the first instance as well. 

Automation tool to perform CRUD operation on Jobs Postings on JazzHr platform.
